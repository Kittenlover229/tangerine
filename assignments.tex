\textbf{How are the tasks rated?}
\end{flushleft}
\begin{flushright}
I want to say randomly, but they aren't. This is my own estimate of how I think
my students will perform based on their level and of the quality of the lecture
I've given previously. 5 stars are the exercises that will take them a
significant amount of time and may requiure external knowledge/research.
The one 1 stars easy and shouldn't take much effort at all. All the others lie 
somewhere inbetween on this range.
\end{flushright}

\begin{flushleft}
\textbf{I'm stuck! What next?}
\end{flushleft}
\begin{flushright}
Do let me know if some exercise made you seriously stumble. Take a break and
go for a walk, maybe try solve it tomorrow, perhaps you are tired. If you can't
crach that exercise to matter what be sure to inform me at the start of our
next lesson, we'll go through it.
\end{flushright}

\begin{flushleft}
\textbf{Why is the document so exquisitely formatted?}
\end{flushleft}
\begin{flushright}
I like it more that way. I am also practising \LaTeX\ in general,
it's really lovely.
