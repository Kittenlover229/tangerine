\begin{lab}{Hangman}
    This lab work is focused on implementing a digital variant of a classical 
    paper-and-pencil game \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangman_(game)}{"Hangman"}.
    Create a small game that formulates a word and accepts user input.
    If the player input is a single letter the program should reveal all the copies of
    that letter in the word. If the word is entirely revealed the player gets one win.
    Every player is assigned a certain number of attempts per formulated words.
    If the letter is not in the word, a single attempt is taken away. If there are 
    no more attempts left the player gets a loss. At the end of each round
    (independent of the win/loss result) the user is shown

    \begin{labext}{Quiet Quitting}
        When encountering a keybord interrupt the app should silently close.
    \end{labext}
    \begin{labext}{Save Files}
        Wins and losses can be tracked across program instances in a file. 
        When starting without a save file such should be created and updated
        upon every win and loss.
    \end{labext}
    \begin{labext}{Dictionary}
        The words to use should be picked from a dictionary file which can be
        specified by the user as the program's first command line argument.
    \end{labext}
    \begin{labext}{Word Guessing}
        Make it possible to try and guess multiple letters or an entire word!
    \end{labext}
